## Downloading

Stable downloads can be obtained from the Releases page [ TODO ].

## Development

Requirements: node 16.13.0+ (Download LTS from https://nodejs.org, check version with `node -v`) and npm 8.1.0+ which should be bundled

After cloning the repository, run `npm ci` to install the dependencies. Run `npm run build` to build the app and `npm start` to start the electron runtime.

## Building

[ TODO ]

## Contributing

Pull requests require at least one accepting review, and error-free passing of a lint check (no new warnings should be added), which can be run with `npm run lint` - append `:js` and `:css` to lint only that part.
Tip: use `npm run lint:fix` to fix some of the errors (watch out for extra diff)
